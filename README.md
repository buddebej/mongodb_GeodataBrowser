NodeJS based webservice, using a small Leaflet Map to browse spatial data in mongodb.
This application is just a prototype and still lacks some major features.

Install dependencies (in app folder):
```js
npm install 
```

Start mongodb daemon:
```js
node index.js <Name of Database>
```

Browse your collections and bring query results on a map.
